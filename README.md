# Aave Governance UI

We are proud to present our design prototype for Aave's new Governance UI.

The designs are on Figma and are available in desktop, tablet, and mobile formats, in both light and dark mode.

The UI is designed to be a fun, visual, simple yet comprehensive, one-stop-shop for the Aave community’s voting and delegation requirements. We believe that it is a considerable improvement over the current UI for the following reasons:

-   Graphs and visualisations on Proposal History, Voting Timelines , Voting Packs, and Governance Delegation Dynamics.
-   Snapshot & Aave Governance Integration. This is an early step in un-fragmenting the Aave governance landscape and allows the community to engage with both on-chain and off-chain voting directly through the UI.
-   New pages dedicated to Voters and Delegates, and Voters/Users.
-   A clean, single column design theme
-   General design and stylistic enhancements such as an increased use of Aave’s colour pallet, and styling effects.
-   Introduction of high-level governance statistics.
-   Page specific FAQ and resource sections, with the aim of demystifying Aave governance for less seasoned practitioners
 
We hope you like it. We're keen to build it :-)
